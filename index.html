  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I have stumbled upon a blog that uses <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. It looked very clean, and I read something about Octopress and it&rsquo;s concepts.</p>

<p>It seemed similar to my current blog setup, meaning that it produces static pages out of the sources, that can then be transferred to the web server and be served very fast and easily.</p>

<p>Octopress also offers easy integration with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Github Pages is a hosting service of Github that is coupled to a GIT repository on GitHub. Just push changes to the GIT repository, and within seconds the changes are reflected on the respective site.</p>

<p>My repository is located <a href="https://github.com/aschei/aschei.github.io">here</a>, and the site can be viewed <a href="http://aschei.github.io">here</a>.</p>

<p>A cool concept octopress makes use of is to keep sources and the generated results in the same repository by using branches. Sources are committed to branch <a href="https://github.com/aschei/aschei.github.io/tree/source">&ldquo;source&rdquo;</a>, while the result is committed to <a href="https://github.com/aschei/aschei.github.io/tree/master">&ldquo;master</a>. The two branches contain conceptually completely different artifacts, and they will never get merged.</p>

<p>The whole setup is really easy to make and it is a joy to work with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When planning this site I have had some ideas what I want to achieve. I wanted a typical
blog site but with extra flexibility for trying out other stuff and learning about
different tools I am interested in.</p>

<p>I have had a special setup in mind: hosted on my own web server, no dynamic / interpreted
content on the server side, just static pages. For sure the pages need to be generated by
a flexible enough mini CMS.</p>

<p>So instead of going on with blogger.com I wanted to control my own web server and
build it from ground up. But I also had a very limiting requirement: no cost. Yes, I want
to try out stuff without paying anything more for it.</p>

<p>So the first thing to decide was about the web server. Luckily, Amazon currently offers
a year of free testing their hosting services. I setup a server on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>
with the latest Debian and read about the service details that are included in Amazons free offer.
Two things to keep in mind: First, you have absolutely no guarantee on backups being made nor
failsafety etc. So it is vital to have your setup elsewhere in case your server is being
reset to factory defaults. I chose to prepare everything on my laptop and rsync stuff in case
of changes. More on that later. Second, you have one fix IP address (they call it Elastic IP)
to be bound on your instances. In case you would like to have a meaningful web server name
using a dynamic DNS hoster, you can register the Elastic IP there and give it a go. But a more
flexible approach is to register your IP automatically when your interface is up using a script
in /etc/network/if-up.d like so:
$$code(lang=bash, style=monokai)</p>

<pre><code>PubIP=$(curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4)
curl --user ${USER}:${PASSWD} https://www.dnsdynamic.org/api/?hostname=${HOST}&amp;myip=${PubIP}
</code></pre>

<p>$$/code
Note: This works if you define USER, PASSWD and HOST before.</p>

<p>The result of this setup was an always-on server reachable in the internet using a meaningful name.
Next step was to decide which http server to use. I wanted a minimalistic setup, but
after reading a while here and there I learned that there are no good alternatives to Apache or
Nginx. Since I am experienced with Apache I went with <a href="http://nginx.org">Nginx</a> to learn something
new. Well, Nginx seems to be a bit easier to setup, but in the end it is just working like Apache.</p>

<p>OK, server is running, what about the CMS? After researching a while I went with
<a href="http://www.blogofile.com/">Blogofile</a> which calls itself a &ldquo;static website compiler&rdquo;. That was
exactly what I was looking for and I installed it on my laptop.</p>

<p>Blogofile gives you for each site a basic setup including features like Blogs etc. It is Python
based (but it can be used without Python knowledge).
It uses <a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/">Mako Templates</a> as a template engine which makes it easy
to change layout and reorganize stuff. For blog posts it supports markdown which I find handy to use.</p>

<p>As a result, whenever I would like to add a blog post I have to add a markdown file in the posts directory
and redeploy the site. For redeployment I am using the following script:
$$code(lang=bash, style=monokai)</p>

<pre><code>blogofile build -s ${site}
rsync -avz -e ssh ${site}/_site/ ${sshhost}:/var/www/
</code></pre>

<p>$$/code
Works like a charm.</p>

<p>If ever the AWS server dies, I would have to reinstall and configure Nginx and the dyndns script,
done. If ever my laptop dies, I would be screwed. Setting up programs like Blogofile is no fun but
possible, but the valuable content would be lost. Therefore I commit my stuff to
<a href="http://github.com">Github</a>.</p>

<p>For me, this is a fun project. I have learned about EC2 on amazon, setting up and securing Debian,
writing shell scripts, Nginx, Blogofile, a little bit Python, and Git on Github. And it gives enough
room to play around.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I strongly recommend to avoid long lists of bugs. Today, we have cool tools like <a href="http://bugzilla.org">Bugzilla</a>
or <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">Jira</a> that make tracking bugs real fun even if there are big numbers of it.</p>

<p>I can imagine a situation where a software product has no known bugs and is complete in a functional sense.
However, I have never been in this situation since I have started working on software. The typical situation I experience is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you have got plenty of things that should be improved, extended, added &ndash; more than you can implement.</p></li>
<li><p>you have got plenty of bug tickets, more than you can handle.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you are in a situation where you sell software you are developing you also have to
weigh effort, priorities, expected damage caused by bugs and expected gain from improvements. You cannot
implement what you want. So how about filling lists of features, lists of bugs, prioritize them, estimate
them roughly, and finally decide what is the next important item that should be implemented? It sounds
promising. You only have to manage one list that is sorted by a function depending on effort, estimate,
priority etc. and sort new items into this list.</p>

<p>Feed the first four items of this ultimate list to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">Kanban-Board</a>
every day and let the developers pick items in order.</p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>In my experience you cannot prioritize bugs and features into one list. You simply cannot compare
them. Maybe a prioritized backlog is good for features, but it is not for bugs. Bugs are not a thing
of planning or betting on. Bugs are the bill you get for your past work. You simply cannot avoid to pay that bill.</p>

<p>I recommend the following to process bugs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If a bug comes in: Decide if it is really a bug or possibly an enhancement (enhancement &ndash;> feature backlog).</p></li>
<li><p>Decide if you want to fix the bug. The decision should only take into account the level of quality
you want to deliver, not what other things you have on your agenda.</p></li>
<li><p>If the bug is not important enough &ndash; and this is the important point &ndash; <em>close it as &ldquo;won&rsquo;t fix&rdquo;</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise choose between three severities: Fix it &ldquo;now&rdquo;, &ldquo;today or tomorrow&rdquo;, &ldquo;within the next two weeks&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign the bug to a person that should fix it actually.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure time spent on bug fixing. If it goes beyond 15 percent take a sharp look what is happening with
your software.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So why not simply give non important bugs a low priority and keep them in the list? Why not say: &ldquo;Hey,
if one has nothing to do: just pick a bug from the &#8220;non-important&rdquo; pool.&ldquo; For me this would be a statement
like &#8220;We provide a quality level that depends on the time that is left over&rdquo;.
It is also unclear if this sort of bugs should be part of a &ldquo;open bugs&rdquo; statistic. More: In the
unlikely case that someone would have time left over: What bug would she select? How would she choose from
the list of 100k bugs?
So just close these bugs and enjoy the pleasures of the real, lean bug list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my current company we had tried out several agile processes including Kanban and Scrum,
but in some areas we have decided to go back to &ldquo;old school&rdquo; practises. We have four week iterations,
continous integration, automated build systems etc. But on the other hand we &ldquo;push&rdquo; tasks to
developers, have code ownership, do very little pair programming and skip to write unit tests in non
trivial areas like UI. We are successful with this process, but it depends how you measure success.</p>

<p>There are some things I do not like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Big back logs, including lot&rsquo;s of prio 4 or 5 bugs you keep to fix them later if you have the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Big stocks of unfinished work, like features in branches that cannot be merged because of x, y, z.</p></li>
<li><p>Requirements on estimations that go beyond a gut feeling. Especially I hate a) to &ldquo;break down&rdquo;
a piece of work, estimate the parts and sum it up, and b) handle estimations like promises.</p></li>
<li><p>Making detailed plans that go beyond the next week. I have no problems with making plans
that define a complete year, but the granularity should be appropriate.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And, there are some practises I am convinced of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stick to quality. If a bug appears: fix it or kill it if it is not worth it. If you see stuff to clean up: clean it up.</p></li>
<li><p>Spend time on infrastructure to automate stuff, spend time on improving performance of your
build process. Use command line scripts to automate stupid, repetitive work.</p></li>
<li><p>Write unit tests that really test a unit of work, i.e. a class. Write unit tests. Do not mistake
integration tests for unit tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&rsquo;t trust process evangelists, every group of people working together in a project needs a
different process to get the best ressults out. And that process needs to be refactored like your code.</p></li>
</ul>
